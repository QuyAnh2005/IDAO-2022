# International Data Analysis Olympiad 2022
This repository contains some materials and my solution in IDAO 2022.

*"Higher School of Economics and Yandex are proud to announce the 5th International Data Analysis Olympiad. Since it’s our 
first anniversary, we decided to change the format: this year we divide students and ML specialists into two separate 
divisions. Only students are able to join in the main competition — the Student Division. All other participants can 
join the Open Division to participate hors concours (for their own interest)."*

### [Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://github.com/QuyAnh2005/International-Data-Analysis-Olympiad-2022/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Bootcamp)
Machine Learning Bootcamp is organized to prepare for official competition IDAO2022
- Some lectures:
    - Categorical Data Encoding Techniques. Practical tricks in data analysis tasks
    - Boosting Algorithms in Machine Learning 
    - Some interesting non-classical applications of machine learning. Machine learning on graph-structured data
  
- Task:
  - Predict sleep disorder on given human health data

### [Qualification Phase](https://github.com/QuyAnh2005/International-Data-Analysis-Olympiad-2022/tree/main/Student%20Division)
There are two separate tracks during the online stage. From the machine learning perspective, the tracks will be similar, 
yet the restrictions put on the solutions are different for each track.

The task is to predict band gap energy for each crystal structure.
